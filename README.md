- 👋 Hi, I’m @sethfduke and I am a software engineer working in Cleveland, Ohio.
- 👀 I’m interested in modern cloud software systems, programming in general, and a big NASA nerd.
- 💞️ I’m always open to collaborating on interesting projects!
- I run a little tech blog at https://www.sethduke.io, so give it a read!
