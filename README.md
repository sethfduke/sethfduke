- 👋 Hi, I’m @sethfduke and I am a software engineer working in Cleveland, Ohio.
- 👀 I’m interested in modern cloud software systems, programming in general, and a big NASA nerd.
- 🌱 I’m currently working full time while attending graduate school.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but feel free to contact me if you feel I could help.
